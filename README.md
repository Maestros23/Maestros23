- ⚡ Fun fact:Did you know that the first computer bug was literally a bug? In 1947,
-  engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found a moth trapped in a relay,
-  causing a malfunction. They derived the term "debugging" to describe the process of fixing errors in computer systems.
-  This  incident led to the widespread use of the term "bug" to describe any flaw or glitch in software.
-  So, the next time you're debugging your code,
-  remember that you're following in the footsteps of those engineers who once removed a literal bug from a computer!
